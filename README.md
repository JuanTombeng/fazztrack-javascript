# FLOWCHART AND ALGORITHMS

#### Description:

## This repository contains basic javascript algorithms with each flowchart images.

## The assignments are: 
1. Reverse each letter in a word:
    * Start
    * Read input
    * Declare an initialize result as an empty string
    * Loop through the input with variable i from the last letter of the input until the first letter of the input
    * Each step, the position of i will decrease 1
    * Adding each value of index i to the variable result
    * Print result

2. Reverse each word in a sentence:
    * Start
    * Read input
    * Declare an initialize result and temp as empty strings
    * Loop through the input with variable i from the first letter of the input until the last letter of the input
    * Each step, the position of i will increase 1
    * Adding each value of index i to variable temp if index i is not a space
    * Adding space, value of temp, and value of result to the result variable if index i is a space
    * Reinitialize temp as an empty string
    * Print value of temp and value of result
* Palindrome checker.
* Change each letter 'a' to letter 'o' in a word.
