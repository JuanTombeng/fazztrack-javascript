# FLOWCHART AND ALGORITHMS

#### Description:

## This repository contains basic javascript algorithms with each flowchart images.

## 1. Reverse each letter in a word:

1. Start
2. Read input
3. Declare and initialize result as an empty string
4. Loop through the input with variable i from the last letter of the input until the first letter of the input
5. Each step, the position of i will decrease by 1
6. While the loop condition is still valid, adding each value of index i to the variable result
7. Print result when the loop condition is not valid anymore
8. End

## 2. Reverse each word in a sentence:

1. Start
2. Read input
3. Declare and initialize result and temp as empty strings
4. Loop through the input with variable i from the first letter of the input until the last letter of the input
5. Each step, the position of i will increase by 1
6. While the loop condition is still valid, adding each value of index i to variable temp if index i is not a space
7. Adding space, value of temp, and value of result to the result variable if index i is a space
8. Reinitialize temp as an empty string
9. Print value of temp and value of result when the loop condition is not valid anymore
10. End

## 3. Palindrome checker:

1. Start
2. Read input
3. Declare and initialize result as empty strings
4. Declare and initialize word as the lower case of the value of the result
5. Loop through the input with variable i from the last letter of the input until the first letter of the input
6. Each step, the position of i will decrease by 1
7. While the loop condition is still valid, adding each value of index i to variable result
8. If value of word is equals as value of result, print "the input is a Palindrome"
9. If the condition if false, print "the input is Not a Palindrome"
10. End

## 4. Change each letter 'a' to letter 'o' in a word:

1. Start 
2. Read input
3. Declare and initialize result as an empty string
4. Loop through the input with variable i from the first index of input to the last index of the input
5. Each step, the position of i will increase by 1
6. While the loop condition is still valid, adding value of result and string 'o' to the variable result if the index i of input is equal as string 'a' or string 'A'
7. If the condition is false, adding value of result and index i of input to the variable result
8. Print value of result when the loop condition is not valid anymore
9. End
